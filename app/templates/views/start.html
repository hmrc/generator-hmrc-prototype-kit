    <p>This prototype example application will flow through a series of prototype screens. <br>
    It aims to demonstrate the following:</p>
    <ul class="list-bullet">
      <li>Use of some typical controls and layout used in a Gov.UK prototyping application.<br>
      You can find out more about the GDI standards here: <a href=" http://govuk-elements.herokuapp.com/"> GOV.UK elements</a></li>
      <li>Some standard ways of handling specific features such as revealing content <br>(e.g. toggled sections based on data choices).</li>
      <li>Persisting entered data for later display later and conditional navigation.</li>
      <li>Using mustache notation to change rendered html page elements based on saved form data passed.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Once you/your team are familiar with this sample application please remove the it by replacing the <span>app/view/examples folder with your project specific one and removing the sample routes in app/routes.js</p>
