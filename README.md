### What is Yeoman?

From the default Yeoman Generator:

>Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.

>Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*


To install Yeoman you will need to have npm (node packaged modules) installed. 

Once Node is installed you'll have access to npm so you can use this to install Yeoman.


```
$ npm install -g yo
```

The -g means that you are installing Yeoman globally. If you wish to uninstall Yeoman you can do so with this command.

```
$ npm uninstall -g yo
```


### Installing this generator

With Node and npm installed run this to install.

```
$ npm install -g generator-hmrcnodeprototype

```


### Using this generator

With the generator installed it is time to run it. Create a directory on your computer somewhere and cd into it via the terminal. Then run:

```
$ yo hmrcnodeprototype
```

### Optional starting of the application on completion
When you run the yo command above you have the option to launch the application on completion.
If you answer yes the application we be started on port 3000 and you can launch it immediatley in your broswer by going to http://localhost:3000
